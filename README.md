## Update: March 5th 2018

I have added new behaviours for stealth and item attribution. A level timer has been installed, but its not fully functional yet.

## Update: Dec 12 2017

So many new features. Item throwing, damage, knockback. So much more to do but its finally feeling like a game!

## Keys

Arrow Keys to move. Space bar to loot. Left Shift to use item. Q to quit.
